  <h1 align ="center">Fatal Road Transport Crashes <br>in Australia</h1>
  <h4>A fatal road transport crash recorded in the Australian Road Deaths Database (ARDD)
     is a crash accident involving road transportations and causes at least one death.</h4>
  <h4>The period studied is between <b>01 January 2015</b> to <b>31 August 2021</b>.</h4>
  <h4>This visualisation aims to explore the trends and patterns of fatal road transport crashes in Australia.</h4>
  
  <h2>Fatal Crashes per 100,000 population by SA4 from 2015 to 2020</h2>
  <p>Note: 2021 was omitted given that the available data only covers up to August 2021
    which makes the crash count for 2021 considerably lower than other years.</p>

    <div class="side-text"><h5>The regression line in the bubble plot shows a slight positive correlation between the number of fatal crashes
      and the average number of deaths per fatal crash.
      <br><br>
      Generally, as the number of fatal crashes increases, more opportunities for higher number of deaths per fatal crash arise
      which consequently increases the average number of deaths per fatal crash.
      <br><br>
      However, the average number of deaths per fatal crash is lesser for more populated SA4s. 
      Major cities with higher population tend to have better infrastructure safety features,
      higher level of safety enforcements and faster post-crash emergency responses. This indicates that there 
      is a greater risk in regional and remote areas.

    minimum death-to-crash ratio is 1.00.</b>
