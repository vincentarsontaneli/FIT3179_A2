  <h1 align ="center">Fatal Road Transport Crashes <br>in Australia</h1>
  <h4>A fatal road transport crash recorded in the Australian Road Deaths Database (ARDD)
     is a reported crash accident involving at least one road vehicle in a road-related area and causes at least one death.</h4>
     <h4>A Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) is the largest sub-state region in the main structure of Australia. </h4>

     <h4>The period studied is between <b>01 January 2015</b> to <b>31 August 2021</b>.</h4>
  <h4>This visualisation aims to explore the trends and patterns of fatal road transport crashes in Australia.</h4>
  
  <h2>Fatal Crashes per 100,000 population by SA4 from 2015 to 2020</h2>
  <p>From 2015 to 2020, <b><span style="color: #fc7d0b">New South Wales (NSW)</span></b> consistently has the highest total number of fatal crashes
     per 100,000 population among the states, having a minimum difference of 40 with the second highest state each year, except
     in 2020 when <b><span style="color: #fc7d0b">NSW</span></b> experienced a large reduction of 27.9% from the previous year.
     On the other hand, <b><span style="color: #1170aa">Queensland (Qld)</span></b>
     experienced a large increase of 21.2% from 2019 to 2020 with a peak value of 110.44.

      SA4s in <b><span style="color: #1170aa">Qld</span></b> have alarmingly high death-to-crash ratios compared to

      with almost 60 fatal crashes each.
      <br><br>
      However, the average number of deaths per fatal crash is lesser for more populated SA4s.
      <b><span style="color: #c85200">Victoria (Vic)</span></b> and <b><span style="color: #fc7d0b">NSW</span></b>

      Major cities tend to 
      have more safety enforcements and faster post-crash emergency responses.
