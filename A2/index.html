  <h1 align="center">Fatal Road Transport Crashes <br>in Australia</h1>
  <h4>A fatal road transport crash recorded in the Australian Road Deaths Database (ARDD)
    is a reported crash accident involving at least one road vehicle in a road-related area and causes at least one
    death.</h4>
  <h4>A Statistical Area Level 4 (SA4) is the largest sub-state region in the main structure of Australia. </h4>

  <h4>The period studied is between <b>01 January 2015</b> to <b>31 August 2021</b>.</h4>
  <h4>This visualisation aims to explore the trends and patterns of fatal road transport crashes in Australia.</h4>

  <h2>Fatal Crashes per 100,000 population by SA4 from 2015 to 2020</h2>
  <p>From 2015 to 2020, <b><span style="color: #fc7d0b">New South Wales (NSW)</span></b> consistently has the highest
    total number of fatal crashes
    per 100,000 population among the states, having a minimum difference of 40 with the second highest state each year,
    except
    in 2020 when <b><span style="color: #fc7d0b">NSW</span></b> experienced a large reduction of 21.8% from the previous
    year.
    On the other hand, <b><span style="color: #1170aa">Queensland (Qld)</span></b>
    experienced a large increase of 21.2% from 2019 to 2020 with a peak value of 110.44.

      <h5>The regression line in the bubble plot shows a slight positive correlation between the number of fatal crashes
        and the average number of deaths per fatal crash.
        <br><br>
        SA4s in <b><span style="color: #1170aa">Qld</span></b> have alarmingly high death-to-crash ratios compared to
        SA4s in other states. <b><span style="color: #1170aa">Townsville</span></b> and
        <b><span style="color: #1170aa">Cairns</span></b> have an an average of 1.20 and 1.19 deaths per fatal crash
        with almost 60 fatal crashes each.
        <br><br>
        However, the average number of deaths per fatal crash is lesser for more populated SA4s.
        <b><span style="color: #c85200">Victoria (Vic)</span></b> and <b><span style="color: #fc7d0b">NSW</span></b>
        have SA4s with large populations and relatively low average deaths such as
        <b><span style="color: #c85200">Melbourne - South East</span></b>.
        Major cities tend to
        have more safety enforcements and faster post-crash emergency responses.

  <h6>Note: the y-axis starts from 1.00 because each fatal road transport crash results at least
      one death, which means the
      minimum death-to-crash ratio is 1.00.

    <h5>Since  2015, the number of fatal road transport crashes in Australia
      has been fluctuating with no clear upward or downward trend. However the most recent month, August 2021,
      had one of the lowest total fatal crashes as it experienced a sharp decrease of 29.6% from July 2021.
      There is also no clear indication of a seasonal pattern in fatal crash occurences in Australia.
      <br><br>
      Most fatal crashes occur between 10:00 to 18:00, which is when
      people are active and likely to be outside walking or driving.
      <br><br>
      Fatal crashes also seem to be higher on weekends than weekdays given that people have more free time and
      are likely to go out late.
      Fatal crashes occur more between 19:00 to 23:00 on Friday and Saturday and 00:00 to 04:00 on Saturday and Sunday
      than other days during the same period.
